## Week one
### Background reading
Most people that go through mathematically rich curricula, such as physics, engineering and even math, never get an overview of what math is about.
Most of the math used in present-day science and engineering is at most 400 years old, yet the high school curriculum is comprised of math at least four hundred years old.

In the 1980s a new definition for mathematics came along: **science of patterns**. E.g arithmetic = patters in counting, calculus = patterns in change, geometry = patterns in shapes.

The development of mathematics has involved a steady increase in the use of **abstract notations**. It's important to note that symbolic notation is just a representation of mathematics, only when understood by someone they become mathematics itself.

In the 19th century the focus of mathematics shifted **from doing to understanding**. 

You should learn the underlying concepts of mathematics for 2 reasons:
- education is not only about providing practical tools, but also passing along the jewels of culture and math is one of the greatest achievements of mankind
- most of the people that work with mathematics nowadays need to find creative solutions using those tools, not only perform calculations; to do that you need a good conceptual understanding of mathematics

### Lecture 1
The mathematician needs to be aware of the **literal meaning** of his sentences, because he cannot rely on anything but the literal meaning.

The truthness of a statement is determined by a **proof**, not a measurement.

In mathematics you cannot rely on context,that's why mathematical language is very restricted and precise.
